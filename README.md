# Get-the-minimum-value-of-a-list-of-numbers_Task
# Overview
  Dart function to determine the minimum value from a list of integers.
# What Does This Code Do?
1. takes a list of integers as input
2.  returns the smallest integer from the list

# How the Code Works?
1. The function getMinimumValue accepts a List<int> as its input parameter.
2. The function initializes the first element of the list as the minimum value.
3. It then iterates through the list using a for loop.
4. The current element is compared with the current minimum value during each iteration. If the current element is smaller, it updates the minimum value.
5. After iterating through the entire list, the function returns the smallest value found.
